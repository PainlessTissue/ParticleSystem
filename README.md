# ParticleSystem

This is a project given to my professor at the end of our class Optimized C++ (you'll see the copyrights all around the project).
The purpose of the project was to use everything we learned throughout the class and apply it to a very poorly written project.
Topics applied included cache friendly data structures, proxy systems, SIMD intrinsics, and plenty more.

There are two branches in the project, the master branch which is the vanilla code given to me, and the MyMods branch
which is my modifications over the vanilla code.

Due to this being a programming class and not a graphics class, there is folders of files we couldn't edit to keep it fair to those
who don't have any background in graphics.
